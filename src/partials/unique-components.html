                            mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food.Early-lactation milk, which is
                            called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system.</p>

                                Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%. One of the best ways to gain an understanding of this type
                                of chocolate is to compare it to a different type of chocolate. Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste
                                comparison, it has a slightly bitter taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow.
